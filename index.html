                <p> 
                    I am addicted and at the same time lazy person. I avoid routine in all areas of my life. I always tried to simplify or automate all routine matters. So, to simplify my work with Excel spreadsheets, I started to learn VBA. Since I had already studied Basic and TurboPaskal at the university, learning VBA at the initial stage did not cause great difficulties and soon I began to apply my knowledge in practice. Then I got carried away by independent study of Java and JavaScript, it became my hobby. In the future, I want to turn this hobby into a profession.
